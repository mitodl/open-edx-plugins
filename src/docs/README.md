# Open edX Plugins

This repository contains a collection of Open edX plugins that provide various custom functionalities for the Open edX platform.

## Installation Guide

Note: Each plugin may require installation in LMS, Studio (CMS), or both environments. Please check the individual plugin's documentation for specific requirements.

You can install any plugin from this collection using one of the following methods:

### Option 1: Install from PyPI

The simplest way to install a plugin is directly from PyPI. If you're running devstack in Docker, first open a shell as per requirement and then install the desired plugin using pip:


```bash
# For LMS or CMS installation
make lms-shell  # For LMS
make cms-shell  # For Studio (CMS) installation

pip install <plugin-name>  # Replace `<plugin-name>` with the specific plugin you want to install
```

### Option 2: Build the package locally and install it

Follow these steps in a terminal on your machine:

1. Navigate to the `open-edx-plugins` directory
2. If you haven't done so already, run ``./pants build``
3. Run ``./pants package ::``. This will create a "dist" directory inside "open-edx-plugins" directory with ".whl" & ".tar.gz" format packages for all plugins

4. Move/copy any of the ".whl" or ".tar.gz" files for this plugin that were generated in the above step to the machine/container running Open edX (NOTE: If running devstack via Docker, you can use ``docker cp`` to copy these files into your LMS or CMS containers)

5. Run a shell in the machine/container running Open edX, and install the plugin using pip

### Post-Installation Steps

1. After installing any plugin, you may need to restart the edx-platform services to apply the changes
2. Some plugins may require additional configuration - refer to the individual plugin's documentation for specific setup instructions
