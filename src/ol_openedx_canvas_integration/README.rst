Canvas Integration Plugin
=============================

A django app plugin to add Canvas integration to Open edX.

**NOTE:**

We had to make some changes to edx-platform itself in order to add the "Canvas" tab to the instructor dashboard.

The ``edx-platform`` branch/tag you're using must include one of the below commit for ``ol-openedx-canvas-integration`` plugin to work properly:

**For "Sumac" or more recent release of edX platform, you should cherry-pick below commit:**

TBA - Will be added when we merge the PR in edx-platform

**For "Quince" to "Redwood" release of edX platform, you should cherry-pick below commit:**

Installation
------------

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the `plugin installation guide <../../docs#installation-guide>`_.``

Installation required in:

* LMS

Configuration
------------

**1) edx-platform configuration**

Add the following configuration values to the config file in Open edX. For any release after Juniper, that config file is ``/edx/etc/lms.yml``. These should be added to the top level. **Ask a fellow developer or devops for these values.**

.. code-block::


    CANVAS_ACCESS_TOKEN: <some access token value>
    CANVAS_BASE_URL: <the base URL where Canvas is running>

**2) Add course settings value**

1) Open your course in Studio.
2) Navigate to "Advanced Settings".
3) Enable other course settings by enabling ``ENABLE_OTHER_COURSE_SETTINGS`` feature flag in CMS
4) Open course advanced settings in Open edX CMS, Add a dictionary in ``{"canvas_id": <canvas_course_id>}``. The ``canvas_course_id`` should be the id of a course that exists on Canvas. (NOTE: Canvas tab would only be visible if this value is set)


How To Use
----------

1. In Studio, create/navigate to a course and create some graded assignments/quizzes.
2. In LMS, open the above course, navigate to the "Instructor" tab, and make sure that you see can see a "Canvas" tab.


Some of the functionality available in this tab:

- ``List enrollments on Canvas`` - Show all enrollments for the course on Canvas.
- ``Merge enrollment list using Canvas`` - Enroll all the users that are present on edX. For the users that don't exist on edX, a ``CourseEnrollmentAllowed`` object will be created.
- ``Overload enrollment list using Canvas`` - Ensure that enrollment records in edX match the enrollments in Canvas (i.e.: create any enrollments that exist in Canvas but don't exist in edX, and delete enrollments that exist in edX but not in Canvas)
- ``Push all MITx grades to Canvas`` - Ensure that Canvas has the equivalent assignments/quizzes for the course, and create/update the user grades for those assignments/quizzes in Canvas (The assignments must have a `Published` status on Canvas)
- ``List Canvas assignments`` - Show a dropdown of all the assignments that are present on Canvas, and upon selecting an assignment, show a list of grades.
